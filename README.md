# Teaching_GitHub_Websites
This was taught through Daniela Cassol (from Thomas Girke lab) and will be a much easier way to prepare one vs having to do it from scratch. Maybe Nat has a better idea of how to prepare this from scratch.
Daniela presented this to my AWIS organization back in January.
Here are her slides https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NaYBZTgE6Oq08D4sLJyDUWeNxy0u1syGwcFCebqWHpY/edit#slide=id.g4dfce81f19_0_45
